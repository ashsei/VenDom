## Introduction and User Stories
My favorite part about moving is house hunting, but something that has always bothered me is that I have 18 different favorites lists across all of the different housing search platforms, and have to have all of the sites open on different tabs to compare between them. VenDom (short for Ventus Domum - "Favorite Home" in Latin) seeks to serve as a middle ground for all of your favorite houses! By clicking "Add a New Property" the user will be prompted to fill out a form from the information they can find on sites such as Zillow, or Truila. After adding the property the user can view all of their favorites side by side, as well as click on the image of each property to view more in depth information.

## Approach
My approach was methodical in which I first wireframed the application idea in a rudimentary sense, as seen in this image:

I then converted this wireframe into a Trello Board that broke the project down into small chunks of functionality, code, and features, as seen in this image:
